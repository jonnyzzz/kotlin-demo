Helper project for one or several repositories from my (Eguene Petrenko)
talks. Check out [jonnyzzz.com/talks](https://jonnyzzz.com/talks)
for more details or rerefernces and slides.

I use the [demo](https://github.com/jonnyzzz/kotlin-demo/tree/demo) branch
to show Kotlin demos for the most of the times. 
There are several more projects to take a look
- https://github.com/jonnyzzz/kotlin-fractals
- https://github.com/jonnyzzz/kotlin-native-clipboard
- https://github.com/jonnyzzz/kotlin-native-mpp-template
 

This branch contains a Kotlin JVM application project. 
It uses `kotlin-jvm` Gradle plugin.

All projects use Gradle with Kotlin DSL.
You may open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio.
